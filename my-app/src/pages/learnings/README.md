How jsx processes arrays
Explain through example of same thing rendered with array and without array

Why we use map instead of forEach or for loop in jsx \* (slightly advanced, can skip first)
Example of how to render a simple list using map
Why map doesn’t work when multiple arrays are involved, and how for loop can be used instead, by generating the array first outside of return

Example of how to render a list with each list item composed of elements from different array

Ho if else works
And convert this to if else if
if (newList[i].score > 80) {
grades.push("A");
}
if (newList[i].score > 60 && newList[i].score < 80) {
grades.push("B");
}
if (newList[i].score > 40 && newList[i].score < 60) {
grades.push("C");
}
if (newList[i].score < 40) {
grades.push("D");
}
